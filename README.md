To use the code by copying and pasting directly from Github:
1. Make a new Java project in Eclipse. It doesn't matter what you name it, just don't create any files in it
2. Open up, in file explorer, your Eclips project file. Navigate to the src folder
3. Create a new folder called MDCalcV2
4. Put the files in this Github repository into that folder
5. Refresh your Eclipse project to find your freshly copied files
6. To update your projects further, simpley copy and paste the code from Github
7. To update Github, either directly edit the files in Github with your changes, or get someone else to merge them

To use this code through git commits and pushes:
1. Make a new Java project in Eclipse. It doesn't matter what you name it, just don't create any files in it
2. Open up, in file explorer, your Eclips project file. Navigate to the src folder and copy the file path for the next step
3. Open up git and change directory to the src folder
4. Clone MDCalcV2 into the folder
5. Refresh your Eclipse project to find your freshly imported files
6. To update the project further, use git pull
7. To update Github, use git add, commit, merge, push, and all that fun stuff

You can theoretically add more java files to the repository and it'll work, but do not add anything other than a java file - Eclipse won't like it at all and will likely break horribly
